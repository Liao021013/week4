# Week 4: Collocation and Unsupervised Classification

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and resources for the Week 4 assignment in GEOL0069. The task involves classifying echoes in leads and sea ice, producing an average echo shape, and computing the standard deviation for these two classes. The classification results are compared against the ESA official classification using a confusion matrix.

## Data Source
The primary dataset used in this assignment is from the provided Jupyter Notebook:
- **Notebook**: `Chapter1_Unsupervised_Learning_Methods_Michel.ipynb`
- **Access**: [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HDSLjsWhLIDF-qbRj6sbGVd9t1LB7890/view?usp=drive_link)

## Installation & Setup
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. You also need the following libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Running the Notebook
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Chapter1_Unsupervised_Learning_Methods_Michel.ipynb
   ```

## Methodology
1. **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning and preparation.
2. **Unsupervised Classification**: Application of clustering algorithms to classify echoes.
3. **Evaluation**: Using a confusion matrix to compare classification results with ESA official classification.

## Results
- Generated an average echo shape for both leads and sea ice.
- Computed standard deviation for each class.
- Evaluated performance using a confusion matrix.
