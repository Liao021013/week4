1. (K-means Clustering Result)
Analysis
This image shows the K-means clustering result applied to a 2D dataset, where each color represents a different cluster.
The gray dots represent cluster centroids.
The data points are evenly distributed, forming four distinct clusters.
Since K-means is a hard clustering method, each point belongs to a single cluster.

2. (GMM Clustering Result)
Analysis
This image presents the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering result for the same dataset.
Each color represents a different category, but unlike K-means, GMM is a soft clustering method, meaning each point has a probability of belonging to multiple clusters.
Since GMM allows cluster overlap, the cluster boundaries are not as well-defined as in K-means.

3. (K-means Clustering on Sentinel-2 Remote Sensing Data)
Analysis
This image shows K-means clustering applied to Sentinel-2 satellite imagery.
The color bar represents cluster labels.
The data is divided into three main categories: purple, green, and yellow.
K-means creates distinct boundaries between different land cover types, but it may oversimplify complex transitions.

4. (GMM Clustering on Sentinel-2 Remote Sensing Data)
Analysis
This image presents the GMM clustering result for Sentinel-2 imagery.
Compared to K-means, GMM produces more gradual transitions between clusters.
Additional clusters may appear due to the probabilistic nature of GMM.

5. Fifth Image (Mean and Standard Deviation of Ice and Lead Data)
Analysis
This plot shows the mean and standard deviation of two categories: ice (blue) and lead (orange).
The shaded area represents the standard deviation, indicating variability in the dataset.
This type of visualization is commonly used for analyzing remote sensing or geophysical data.

6. (Histogram of Data Distribution)
Analysis
This histogram represents the distribution of multiple data categories.
The Y-axis represents the number of data points, while the X-axis represents the data values.
The peak concentration suggests that the data originates from a similar measurement range.
7. (Duplicate Histogram)
Analysis
This histogram appears to be a duplicate of the previous image.
If it does not provide additional insights, it may be redundant and can be removed.

8. (Another Histogram of Data Distribution)
Analysis
This histogram shows a broader distribution than the previous ones.
The data values are more dispersed, which may result from different datasets or measurement scales.

9. (Scatter Plot: K-means Clustering on sig_0 vs. PP Variables)
Analysis
This scatter plot visualizes K-means clustering on sig_0 and PP variables.
The yellow and purple colors represent different clusters.
A clear grouping pattern is observed, suggesting a strong separation between the two categories.

10. (Scatter Plot: GMM Clustering on sig_0 vs. SSD Variables)
Analysis
This image is similar to the previous scatter plot, but it uses GMM clustering instead of K-means.
Since GMM is a soft clustering method, the boundaries are more diffuse.
The distribution of points suggests that the data has overlapping characteristics.

11.(Scatter Plot: GMM Clustering on SSD vs. PP Variables)
Analysis
This plot displays the relationship between SSD and PP variables, clustered using GMM.
The yellow cluster mainly occupies lower SSD values, while the purple cluster is more scattered.
Some outliers (purple points far from the main cluster) suggest possible noise in the dataset.

12. (Plot of 10 Aligned Functions from Cluster 0 in GMM)
Analysis
This plot shows 10 equally spaced functions from Cluster 0 in the GMM model.
The X-axis likely represents wavelength or time, and the Y-axis represents a measured environmental variable.
A significant peak near 150 suggests that this category shares a common characteristic at that point.
